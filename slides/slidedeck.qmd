# Introduction

## What is Missing Data and what are the impacts?

- Missing data are null values in a dataset caused by issues such as non-responses or faulty measurement sensors
-   Types of missing data: MAR, MCAR, and MNAR
-   Imperfect datasets with missing values can impact the legitimacy and reliability of the results obtained.

## Imputation

-   Simple Imputation: Replacing the missing value with one imputed value.
-   Multiple Imputation: Creating multiple datasets with multiple imputed values.
-   Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equation: Method that anticipates missing data by using existing data for other variables.
