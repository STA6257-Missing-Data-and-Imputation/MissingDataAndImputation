    "text": "Introduction\nAs much as researchers may attempt to eliminate or reduce missing values, datasets are rarely, if ever, perfect, which can impact the legitimacy and reliability of the results obtained. There are four main reasons for missing data: missing completely at random, missing at random, missing depending on unobserved predictors, and missingness that depends on the missing value itself.\nMissing data is a critical issue that can lead to global crises and cybersecurity threats. Researchers have struggled with univariate imputation and deletion, but modern methods are being tested to find the best missing data handling solutions. Multivariate chained equation imputation is a method that prevents missing data during data collection. Bayesian posterior distribution simulation has been improved by researchers. Missing data in data analysis reduces model accuracy, and unknown data detection methods like MCAR and MAR are necessary. Single imputation and deletion are the simplest assumptions, while maximum likelihood and multiple imputation are optimal for missing data. Reliable statistical results require identifying missingness processes to ensure accurate data analysis.\nMissing completely at random (MCAR) is best described as data missing entirely at random and unrelated to observed or unobserved factors. Missing at random (MAR) describes a missing variable due to other observed variables within the data set. Missing depending on unobserved predictors (MNAR) describes the missing variable due to unobserved factors within our data set. Missingness that depends on the missing value describes missing data due to the information the participant does not want to make available.\nWhen data is missing in a dataset, it can be handled in two ways. First would be to simply delete the missing data from the dataset. This is generally the best method if the data is missing at random and makes up for a small amount of the larger dataset. If the data is not missing at random, or if deleting it would remove a substantial amount of the data, there is a statistical technique to handle missing data known as “imputation.” The most common type of imputation is single and multiple. “In single imputation, imputed values are considered as actual values. Single imputation ignores the fact that the actual value cannot be predicted for sure by any imputation method. Single imputation based methods do not consider the uncertainty of the imputed values. Instead, they recognize the imputed values as actual values in subsequent analysis.” (Khan and Hoque 2020) Single imputation replaces missing values by using multiple methods, such as replacing the missing value by copying the previous participants’ value, copying over the worst value in the data set, or calculating the mean for the variable. With a single imputation, there is no distinction between observed and imputed values, which could lead to bias, influenced by outliers, can spread errors, no way to detect the imputed values, and this methodology cannot be used for complex data. Despite these drawbacks, simple imputation is one of the most popular types of imputation due to its simplicity and status as the default imputation method in many statistical packages. (Zhang 2016)\n“Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equation (MICE) predicts missing data using the existing data of other variables. Then it replaces missing values using the predicted values and creates a dataset called imputed dataset. By iteration, it creates multiple imputed datasets. Each dataset is then analyzed using standard statistical analysis techniques, and multiple analysis results are provided.” (Khan and Hoque 2020) The downside of this methodology is that it can be complex to implement, assumes that the data is missing at random, has a risk of overfitting, and requires many resources; however, it has the ability to impute more accurate data than single imputation based on underlying patterns in the data.\nTo demonstrate the benefits of imputation, we will create missingness in a predictor variable and create a model by excluding the missing data. Then we will perform imputation on the dataset and recreate the model to see if there is a difference in performance. Before we perform imputations on the penguins (Horst, Hill, and Gorman 2020) dataset, first the data must be cleaned to omit all incomplete records so we can have the actual values to compare our imputations against. The code block below demonstrates the penguins dataset that we will be using, cleaning the incomplete records, and displays the correlation using the ggplot2 [Wickham (2016)] package between body_mass_g and flipper_legth_mm that we will be using to construct a model before and after imputation of missing data.\n\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(missMethods)\nlibrary(simputation)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nset.seed(1) \n\npenguins <- readr::read_csv('penguins.csv')\n\n\npenguin_rows_with_na <- penguins[!complete.cases(penguins), ]\nprint(penguin_rows_with_na)\n\n# A tibble: 11 × 8\n   species island    bill_length_mm bill_depth_mm flipper_length_mm body_mass_g\n   <chr>   <chr>              <dbl>         <dbl>             <dbl>       <dbl>\n 1 Adelie  Torgersen           NA            NA                  NA          NA\n 2 Adelie  Torgersen           34.1          18.1               193        3475\n 3 Adelie  Torgersen           42            20.2               190        4250\n 4 Adelie  Torgersen           37.8          17.1               186        3300\n 5 Adelie  Torgersen           37.8          17.3               180        3700\n 6 Adelie  Dream               37.5          18.9               179        2975\n 7 Gentoo  Biscoe              44.5          14.3               216        4100\n 8 Gentoo  Biscoe              46.2          14.4               214        4650\n 9 Gentoo  Biscoe              47.3          13.8               216        4725\n10 Gentoo  Biscoe              44.5          15.7               217        4875\n11 Gentoo  Biscoe              NA            NA                  NA          NA\n# ℹ 2 more variables: sex <chr>, year <dbl>\n\npenguins_filtered <- na.omit(penguins)\n\n\nggplot(penguins_filtered, aes(body_mass_g, flipper_length_mm)) + \n  geom_count() + \n  geom_smooth(method='lm')\n\n\n\n\nIn the code block below, we will create 50% missing at random data in the column flipper_length_mm using the missMethods (Rockel 2022) package. Then we will create a linear regression to display the r-squared that would be achieved without performing any imputation on the data set.\n\npenguins_missing <- delete_MCAR(penguins,0.5,\"flipper_length_mm\")\n\nregg = lm(body_mass_g~ flipper_length_mm, data = penguins_missing, na.action=na.omit) \nprint(paste(summary(regg)$adj.r.squared, \"is the R-Squared for the linear model where missing values are excluded from the dataset.\"))\n\n[1] \"0.756874976743334 is the R-Squared for the linear model where missing values are excluded from the dataset.\"\n\n\nAlthough this R-Squared is good, it omits half of the data since 50% of the values for flipper_length_mm are missing. In the following code blocks, we will explore imputation of the the missing data.\n\n# Make a copy of the dataset and calculate the mean of the specific column\npenguins_Mean_imputated <- penguins_missing\n\n\n# If we only replaced the missing values for flipper_length_mm\nflipper_length_mm_mean_value <- mean(penguins$flipper_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)\npenguins_Mean_imputated$flipper_length_mm[is.na(penguins_Mean_imputated$flipper_length_mm)] <- flipper_length_mm_mean_value\npenguins_Mean_imputated[!complete.cases(penguins), ]\n\n# A tibble: 11 × 8\n   species island    bill_length_mm bill_depth_mm flipper_length_mm body_mass_g\n   <chr>   <chr>              <dbl>         <dbl>             <dbl>       <dbl>\n 1 Adelie  Torgersen           NA            NA                201.

Now we will proceed to impute linear model predicted values using the simputation (Loo 2022) package into the missing data set for bill_length_mm and construct the same model to achieve an increase in r-squared.\n\npenguins_imputed <- impute_lm(penguins_missing, flipper_length_mm ~ species + bill_length_mm + bill_depth_mm)\n\nregg = lm(body_mass_g~ flipper_length_mm, data = penguins_imputed)\nprint(paste(summary(regg)$adj.r.squared, \"is the R-Squared for the linear model where imputation of missing values was performed with another linear model before modeling.\"))\n\n[1] \"0.773206900379413 is the R-Squared for the linear model where imputation of missing values was performed with another linear model before modeling.\"\n\n\nAs shown in the R-Squared output for each model. We can see a small improvement in the accuracy of this model by performing imputation. This accuracy was possible since there wasnt an issue with missing values in species, bill_length_mm, and bill_depth_mm which were used to impute flipper_length_mm. But what happens if these variables contained large amounts of missing values that must be replaced as well?\n\npenguins_missing <- delete_MCAR(penguins,0.5,c(\"flipper_length_mm\",\"bill_length_mm\",\"bill_depth_mm\",\"body_mass_g\",\"species\",\"sex\"))\ntryCatch(\n  {\n  penguins_imputed_missing <- impute_lm(penguins_missing, flipper_length_mm ~ species + bill_length_mm + bill_depth_mm)\n\n  penguins_imputed_missing[!complete.cases(penguins_imputed_missing), ]\n\n  regg = lm(body_mass_g~ flipper_length_mm, data = penguins_imputed_missing)\n  print(paste(summary(regg)$adj.r.squared, \"is the R-Squared for the linear model where imputation of missing values was performed with another linear model before modeling.\"))\n  },\n  error = function(e) \n  {\n    print(\"This caused an error!\") # or whatever error handling code you want\n  }\n)\n\n[1] \"This caused an error!\"\n\n\nIt is important to note, that although it appears that we are imputing missing values in the code, the linear model fails to impute when there are missing values in the predicting variables. To avoid this error, below we will impute most of the missing data with mean or mode and attempt to impute flipper_length_mm with a linear model. This method will not be accurate due to the same underlying issue that we saw with imputing mean before.\n\npenguins_missing <- delete_MCAR(penguins,0.5,c(\"flipper_length_mm\",\"bill_length_mm\",\"bill_depth_mm\",\"body_mass_g\",\"species\",\"sex\"))\nbill_length_mm_mean_value <- mean(penguins$bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)\nbill_depth_mm_mean_value <- mean(penguins$bill_depth_mm, na.rm = TRUE)\nflipper_length_mm_mean_value <- mean(penguins$flipper_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)\nbody_mass_g_mean_value <- mean(penguins$body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE)\nspecies_mode_value <- mode(penguins$species)\nsex_mode_value <- mode(penguins$sex)\n\n# Replace NAs in the specific column with the mean\npenguins_Mean_imputated$bill_length_mm[is.na(penguins_Mean_imputated$bill_length_mm)] <- bill_length_mm_mean_value\npenguins_Mean_imputated$bill_depth_mm[is.na(penguins_Mean_imputated$bill_depth_mm)] <- bill_depth_mm_mean_value\npenguins_Mean_imputated$flipper_length_mm[is.na(penguins_Mean_imputated$flipper_length_mm)] <- flipper_length_mm_mean_value\npenguins_Mean_imputated$body_mass_g[is.na(penguins_Mean_imputated$body_mass_g)] <- body_mass_g_mean_value\npenguins_Mean_imputated$species[is.na(penguins_Mean_imputated$species)] <- species_mode_value\npenguins_Mean_imputated$sex[is.na(penguins_Mean_imputated$sex)] <- sex_mode_value\n\npenguins_Mean_imputated[!complete.cases(penguins_Mean_imputated), ]\n\n# A tibble: 0 × 8\n# ℹ 8 variables: species <chr>, island <chr>, bill_length_mm <dbl>,\n#   bill_depth_mm <dbl>, flipper_length_mm <dbl>, body_mass_g <dbl>, sex <chr>,\n#   year <dbl>\n\npenguins_imputed <- impute_lm(penguins_Mean_imputated, flipper_length_mm ~ species + bill_length_mm + bill_depth_mm)\n\nregg = lm(body_mass_g~ flipper_length_mm, data = penguins_imputed)\nprint(paste(summary(regg)$adj.r.squared, \"is the R-Squared for the linear model where imputation of missing values was performed with another linear model before modeling.\"))\n\n[1] \"0.401560117419619 is the R-Squared for the linear model where imputation of missing values was performed with another linear model before modeling.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nHorst, Allison Marie, Alison Presmanes Hill, and Kristen B Gorman. 2020. “Palmerpenguins: Palmer Archipelago (Antarctica) Penguin Data.” https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3960218.\n\n\nKhan, Shahidul Islam, and Abu Sayed Md Latiful Hoque. 2020. “SICE: An Improved Missing Data Imputation Technique.” Journal of Big Data 7 (1). https://doi.org/10.1186/s40537-020-00313-w.\n\n\nLoo, Mark van der. 2022. “Simputation: Simple Imputation.” https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=simputation.\n\n\nRockel, Tobias. 2022. “missMethods: Methods for Missing Data.” https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=missMethods.\n\n\nWickham, Hadley. 2016. “Ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis.” https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org.\n\n\nZhang, Zhongheng. 2016. “Missing Data Imputation: Focusing on Single Imputation.” Annals of Translational Medicine 4 (1). https://atm.amegroups.org/article/view/8839."
